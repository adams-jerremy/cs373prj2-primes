#summary Documentation of main.py

= Introduction =

main.py solves the sum of four primes problem according to UVA rules for integers less than 10,000,000.  It utilizes the Goldbach's conjecture and a few optimizations.


= Details =

==Functions==

*main()* The main driver program.  Executes read-eval-print loop.

*my_read()* Reads a single integer from stdin.  

*my_eval()* Finds two primes that sum to it's argument.  Argument to my_eval must be even and less than or equal to 10,000,000. 

*print()* Prints four prime integers to stdout that sum to the input. Prints impossible if the input was less than 8. 

*binarySearch()* Searches for an element in a collection using the classic, iterative, in-place, binary search algorithm.

*isPrime()* Tests for primality of argument by searching a cache or by checking the remainder of all primes up to the square root of the argument.
